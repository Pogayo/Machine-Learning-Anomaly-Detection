# Algorithms and approaches to anomaly detection
## What is it?
Anomaly detection is a technique that is used to identify rare data that stand out from the rest.
The techniques used can be categorized into  supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection methods.

## Supervised methods
Requires a labeled dataset with both anomalous and normal data.
Most commonly used are:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. K Nearest Neighbours
3. Bayesian Network
4. Decision Trees
3. Neural Networks etc
## Unsupervised methods
1. K-Means clustreing
2. Isolation forest etc
