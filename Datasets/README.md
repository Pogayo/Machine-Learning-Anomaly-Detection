# About
These are datasets that I use and you can use to explore anomaly detection.
I'll try as much as possible to avail them in CSV format and incude a glossary. 

## Datasets not uploaded directly here
1. [KDD Cup 1999 Data](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html)
2. [Links to benchmark anomaly datasets](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_anomaly_detection_benchmark_datasets)
